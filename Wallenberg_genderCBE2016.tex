\begin{frame}{Introduction}

	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Linguistic sex/gender effects:} it is well known that speaker-sex has a stochastic effect on the frequency with which linguistic variants are used. Reasons unknown.
		\item \textbf{Hormonal Organising Effects:} the action of sex steroids, during the critical period for sexual differentiation 
		(\textsl{in utero}, esp. weeks 8-24 for humans), affecting primary/secondary sex characteristics, and ``gender'':
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Behaviour: mating behaviours in mammals, sexuality and gender identity in humans, pair-bonding and other behaviours in birds.
				\item Brain morphology: e.g. the sexually-dimorphic nucleus of the pre-optic area in mammals, including humans, with a correlate in birds; also e.g. parts of the avian song system \citep[][]{balthazartetal2009}.
				\item Not to be confused with hormone activational, or circulating, effects, which are often independent.
			\end{itemize}

\section{Linguistic Sex Effects}
\subsection{Reported Effects}

\begin{frame}{Sex/Gender and Change from Below}
\begin{itemize}
	\item When linguistic changes begin, a new linguistic feature is innovated, and has to spread through a population.
	\item As it spreads, there is both inter-speaker and intra-speaker variation, essentially for all variants studied.
	\begin{exe}
		\ex \begin{xlist}
			\ex Have you any money?
			\ex Do you have any money?
		\end{xlist}	  (British Isles)
		\ex John is going to his \{$[$haus$]$/$[$h√¶\textschwa s$]$\}. \\(Philadelphia English)
		\ex I want to, \{\textsl{um, uh}\}, tell you some things. \\(All Englishes so far, and Dutch?!)
	\end{exe}
		
	\item Women tend to lead \textbf{changes from below} the level of consciousness (see \citealt[][Chapt. 8]{labov2001} long list of references up to that date).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Theories Proposed (and not proposed)}

\begin{frame}{\citet{labov2001}}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item New variant initially spreads among women, by chance.
		\item All children get most of their linguistic input from women caregivers.
		\item Men in pre-adolescence retreat from women-led changes, so as to distinguish themselves socially.
		\item The change increments in each generation (reason unknown), with men staying behind women (and still retreating??).
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{center}
		Labov entertains two possible biological possibilities, but dismisses them: one based on sexually dimorphic verbal ability, and another which only applies to vowels.
	\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale = .73]{smith1.png}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\citet{eckert2011}}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item New variant spreads anywhere in the population.
	\item In pre-adolescence, women figure out which is the new variant.
	\item Women adopt more of the new variant to distinguish themselves as ``trendy'', ``flamboyant'', in the ``heterosexual marketplace''.
	\item Change increments in each generation because women continue this bias.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problems with Labov, Eckert}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Even though there's a proposed psychological and/or social effect, the mechanism for it is unexplained; except:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Labov implicates men in retreating.
		\item Eckert implicates women in pushing change forward.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Neither clearly explains what's pushing the change forward, though Eckert tries (but maybe we'll never know).
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Problems with Labov, Eckert}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Both imply some social awareness of the change as a whole and its trajectory, but this effect specifically shows up in Changes from Below.
	\item Also, while the effect is significant, the size of the effect is so small that it may not be effective social signaling (in an information theoretical sense) of any kind, especially towards the middle of the change (Fruehwald, \textsl{to appear}).
	\item \textbf{Prediction:} men should be 1 generation behind if they run away in 1st generation, or if women drive the change itself (which might be true). Men should be increasingly more behind if they run away many times.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Blind Social Network (Bloomfield)}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Change spreads in women first, by chance.
	\item Men jump on board at the same rate, and they never catch up.
	\item The change increments in each generation for unknown reasons.
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Possible problem with acquisition, from caregiver data.
	\item Must assume that there is no real trend for women to lead change from below.
	\item Prediction: men should be 1 generation behind or less (?), with the lag remaining constant.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{A socio-biological model}

\begin{frame}{A socio-biological model}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[ ] \textbf{Theory:} one effect of hormonal organising effects is on how people learn socially from models of different sex/gender.
	\begin{itemize} \item Learning from social models differs by gender (and so is roughly sexually dimorphic). \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Change spreads anywhere first, by chance, driven by an unknown factor (but \textbf{note} Kevin Stadler's work).
	\item Women copy women more than men copy anyone.
	\item Women increment the change at a rate determined by the unknown factor, while men miss the incrementation some of the time.
	\item Men should be increasingly behind in each generation, showing a different rate of change.
	\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A socio-biological model}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Hypothesis:} the difference should show up not only between different sex (genetic, genital, or assigned-at-birth) cohorts, but also within them by gradient gender.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Hormonal Organising Effects}

\subsection{Gender Behavioural Effects}

\begin{frame}{CAH women}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: genetic disorder which inhibits the synthesis of cortisol, which causes the adrenals to secrete high levels of androgens, e.g. T.
	\item CAH women have measurably high levels of pre-natal T, and often partially masculinized genitalia \citep[][and refs therein]{pasterskietal2005, balthazart2011}.
	\item Socialized as women.
	\item Usually receive hormone replacement therapy and other treatment upon birth, so circulating androgens and estrogens are like non-CAH women.
	\item A number of studies have shown CAH women to show more masculine-typical behaviours from childhood into adulthood, including adult gender-identity and sexuality \citep[see][for reviews]{hines2006, balthazart2011}.

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{\citet{pasterskietal2005}}
\begin{block}{Study Design}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Compares CAH women and CAH men to control \textbf{siblings}, between 3-10 years old: 34 females and 31 males with CAH, 27 unaffected sisters and 25 brothers.
	\item Children allowed 8 minutes free play with various male-typical and female-typical toys (first 6 minutes scored for toy choice).
	\item CAH women's play was significantly different from all men and control women.
	\item In short, with the scores converted to ratios of ``girls' toys'' / all toys...

\begin{block}{Study Results}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children \citep{alspac2001}
	\item A maternal blood sample was taken from gestational weeks 5-36, though they targeted 16-20
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 55\% between weeks 8-24
			\item 24\% between weeks 5-7
			\item 21\% between weeks 25-36
		\end{itemize}
	\item Assays for T and sex hormone-binding globulin.
	\item Pre School Activities Inventory (PSAI); at age 3.5, parents score children's various gender-related behaviors from 1-5
	%\item see also review in \citep{hines2006}
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{ALSPAC Study \citep{hinesetal2002}}
\begin{block}{Study Design}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item PSAI scores were used to select 6 groups of children for T and SHBG assays:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 128 boys, 113 girls with the most masculine (highest) PSAI scores for their sex cohorts.
			\item 112 boys, 118 girls with the most feminine (lowest) PSAI scores for their sex cohorts.
			\item 102 boys, 106 girls randomly selected from remainder of cohorts.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{ALSPAC Study \citep{hinesetal2002}}
\begin{block}{Summary of Results}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item one-way ANCOVA within \textsl{girls} indicated significant relationship between T and PSAI group, F(2, 310) = 5.80, p = 0.003, with a significant linear trend (F(1, 328) = 7.39, p = 0.001) of increasing PSAI (by group) with increasing T.
	\item No significant effect of SHBG.
	\item No significant effect of T or SHBG within \textsl{boys}.
	\item \textbf{Interpretation:} maternal T during gestation affects gender role behaviour in 3.5-year-olds, but:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The effect is unobservable in men because it's overwhelmed by fetal T produced by the testes
		\end{itemize}
	\item Not entirely sure how I feel about the statistical procedure here, but I believe there is an effect, if small and noisy (probably partly due to the rough PSAI instrument).
%	\item \citet{auyeungetal2009} confirmed results in a more controlled study: predicting PSAI (including toy choice) with amniotic fluid samples all within gestation weeks 11-21.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Social behaviour: eye-contact ref Lutchmaya, empathy stuff? other baron-cohen
	\item mention birdies stuff

	\item unpublished hines things
	\item maybe this will really fill a gap in the litearure
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Social Learning}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Because of the possibility of more direct experimental manipulation, animal studies showing the behavioural results of hormonal organising effects make the human studies more convincing.
	\item There are lots of non-human studies showing the result of hormonal organising on brain morphology \citep[e.g. in rats, going back to][]{gorski1978}, sexuality \citep[many references in][Chapts. 3-4]{balthazart2011}, and birdsong \citep[see][for an overview]{balthazartetal2009}.
	\item There's less explicitly on the effect of hormonal organising on social learning, though this may be implicit in the human studies above, and implicit in the birdsong literature (though these do not always distinguish learning from production).
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\citet{mansukhanietal1996}}
\begin{block}{Study Design}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pair-bonding preferences in female zebra-finches, who partner for life.
	\item Not the same as mating-preferences, which have been investigated in a number of species; presumably more related to social learning.
	\item 30 females, in two conditions: raised in all-female aviaries vs. mixed aviaries, and treatment with estradiol benzoate (synthetic estradiol) vs. no treatment
		\begin{itemize}
		\item All subsequently given hormone treatments to equalize adult circulating hormone levels.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{\citet{mansukhanietal1996}}
\begin{block}{Results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Significant effects of EB treatment on plumage, singing, dancing, and mounting behaviours in choice tests.
	\item However, EB treatment only significantly affected pair-bonding behaviours in colony tests \textbf{with females also raised in all-female aviaries}.
	\item \textbf{Interpretation:} the masculinizing, organisational effect of estradiol affected the process of learning suitable models for pairing.
	\item The brain structures affected must be implicated in social learning, beyond directly instinctual behaviours (e.g. mounting, dancing (?))
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The singing data is ambiguous, since it must be learned, but we don't know which part of the song system has been changed here \citep[see][]{balthazartetal2009}.

\begin{frame}{Hines' social learning}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Some unpublished experimental evidence suggests (Balthazart p.c., citing \citealt{hines2012}):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Non-CAH women tend to mimic female models in an artificial social learning task.
			\item (non-CAH) men are not significantly affected by any models in the same task.
			\item CAH women are similarly unaffected, and not distinguishable from male participants.

\section{Our Pilot Study}

\begin{frame}{Sample}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 17 participants, all native speakers of English from Tyneside
	\item All assigned-female-at-birth (AFAB) and self-identifying as female.
	\item None have known endocrine disorders, or know their families to have endocrine conditions.
	\item Similar educational backgrounds: all attended secondary school, nearly all post-university
	\item Ages between 20-45 years old.
	
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Methodology}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Standard sociolinguistic interview procedures \citep{tagliamonte2006}; about an hour of speech per participant (interviewers Claire and Joel), recorded digitally on Zoom H4n in WAV.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Basic personal and social history, including social network size (not analyzed yet).
			\item Asked whether or not they were called ``tomboy''
			\item Module on sexuality and sexual history, coded later in Kinsey scores (0-6) by Joel
			\item Module on gender identity.
			\item Transcribed (Claire, Caitlin, Charlotte).
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textsl{um, uh} automatically extracted from transcripts, plus some phonological environment information.
	\item 2D:4D digit ratio: photocopies of hands, 2D, 4D measured with Vernier digital calipers (Joel); \citet{allawayetal2009} found this to be the second-best method.
	\item Gender scale task, also measured with digital calipers, converted to ratio.
\end{itemize}

\section{Our (Future) Study}

\begin{frame}{Future Study}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A sample of 200 participants from ALSPAC
	\item Assays for maternal T and estradiol. (To the extent possible, we will sample the same participants studied in \citealt{hinesetal2002}). 
	\item Standard sociolinguistic interview procedures \citep{tagliamonte2006}; about an hour of speech per participant.
	\item Semi-automatic extraction of changes in progress from transcribed audio.
	\item 2D:4D from scans using virtual calipers in pixels, sexuality info, gender info.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future Study}
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Nice categorical change from below: \textsl{um/uh}
	\item Some below-consciousness phonetic and phonological variables (maybe production and perception), such as:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item /uw/-fronting
			\item Pre-aspiration
			\item Amount of coarticulation across word-boundaries
			\item ultrasound /r/
			\item VOT?
%			\item perceptual compensation for coarticulation (relating to social learning?)
			
			\end{itemize}
	\item Maybe a more stable, sociolinguistically sensitive variable, e.g. h-dropping?
	\item If possible, a syntactic variable (relative clause extraposition?; Wallenberg \textsl{to appear})

	\item Some self-report gender identity measures.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Worth seeing if there are openly gender-nonconforming people in ALSPAC.
		\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Future Study: Hypothesis}

\begin{center}
\item If linguistic variables are learnt differentially depending on how masculinised brain structures have been by pre-natal androgen levels, then:
\end{center} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Within a given sex cohort (i.e. genital-sex, or sex designated at birth), more advanced linguistic variants correspond to lower levels of pre-natal T, and perhaps other androgens (esp. women).
	\item If the gender effect in language is purely social, then we should see no effect of hormones within each sex (only between sexes).
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}


\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
%	\begin{block}{Conclusions}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item There's no clear explanation of the linguistic effects in ``purely social'' terms, though there are a few ideas.
			\item Biological explanations have generally been dismissed.
			\item Hormonal organising action suggests a partly biological, partly social model, with the following properties:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It could explain both sex/gender effects based on independently attested mechanisms.
			\item The view of gender is interestingly non-binary or gradient, which tallies with people's self-reports of gender identity.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Though we'd like more independent data on social learning, this study could provide additional evidence.
			\item Linguistic productions could be a more precise measure of social learning, than rougher questionnaire and experimental techniques.
